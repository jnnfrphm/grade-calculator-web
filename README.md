# grade-calculator-web
a simple web page that helps you calculate your grade
most of the times grades on canvas or gradescope only report your grade as a fraction
i tend to use [this gem](https://www.rapidtables.com/calc/grade/grade-calculator.html) which doesn't accept grades as a fraction
so i implemented a simple weighted grade calculator that accepts grades as a fraction to avoid having to complete a two step process to ensure i don't fail my classes :)
