# grade calculator (web)

### description
a simple web page that helps you calculate your grade

### motivation
when calculating your grade for your classes, you have a few options:
1) manually using calculator
2) a web-based calculator such as [RapidTables](https://www.rapidtables.com/calc/grade/grade-calculator.html)

option one allows accuracy and flexibility in how values are entered, such as inputting values as a decimal, percentage, or fraction. however, this approach can be time consuming since you may need to meticuously insert parenthesis and addition signs where necessary
option two is much simpler, since users can put in their grade parcentage and the weight for an assignment. however, RapidTables does not support fractional inputs. thus users must rely on an external calculator to calculate their fractional grade as a percentage.

this is the motivation for my grade calculator. most assignments are reported back as a fraction. (number of points earned/number of points possible) as a result this web page takes grades as a fraction and weights as a decimal to calculate a user's grade

tldr: i didn't want to have to go through the lengthy process of manually typing each assignment into a calculator and RapidTables doesn't accept fractional inputs so i wrote this simple web app to calculate my grade

### further development
currently this version only calculates a user's current grade. future versions hope to include features that calcuate a user's needed grade to obtain a desired grade
